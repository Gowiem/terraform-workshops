# Exercise #1: Refresh w/ a Project Exercise

We want this exercise to be a refresher on some key topics, and adding just a few new concepts or twists as we jump back into a path toward intermediate knowledge

Some intro topics refreshed in this exercise:

* input variables, tfvars
* providers, and the AWS provider specifically
* use of modules
* use of data sources
* local variables
* outputs
* tracking 0.11 vs 0.12 deprecated syntax
* the root `terraform` block

## Let's jump right in

Go ahead run `terraform init` in this project directory:

```
$ terraform init
Initializing modules...
Downloading terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws 3.13.0 for security_group...
- security_group in .terraform/modules/security_group/terraform-aws-security-group-3.13.0

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.70.0...


Warning: Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated

  on main.tf line 10, in provider "aws":
  10:   region  = "${var.region}" # we're using 0.12, and newer versions will warn us if we write this "${var.region}" instead of var.region

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be
provided via interpolation syntax, but this pattern is now deprecated. To
silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

Template interpolation syntax is still used to construct strings from
expressions when the template includes multiple interpolation sequences or a
mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Let's look at the individual pieces of this output to re-familiarize ourselves with some pieces of `terraform init`

```
Initializing modules...
Downloading terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws 3.13.0 for security_group...
- security_group in .terraform/modules/security_group/terraform-aws-security-group-3.13.0
```

One of `terraform init`'s jobs is to identify modules defined in configuration source and pull them in to the .terraform directory so they can be used when running further `terraform` commands. Here we see `init` identifying a third-party module defined in source and pulling it appropriately. Here's what the module call/definition looks like in our source:

```
module "security_group" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"
  version = "3.13.0"
  name = var.student_alias
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.default.id
}
```

This is a pretty standard module block, using a [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) provided module. So, one that Hashicorp hosts in its official community registry of modules. Our `init` command has pulled this module from that registry locally to our machine so that we can use it. Notice also, that we've set an explicit version for the module to use, so we can lock to using only this version whenever we run Terraform against this configuration. NOTE: the `version` argument for `module` is only relevant to module whose `source` is Terraform Registry or Terraform Cloud.

Let's look at where and how our `init` command downloaded the module:

```
$ ls -lah .terraform/modules/
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  4 patrickforce  staff   128B Aug  7 07:45 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 patrickforce  staff   128B Aug  7 07:45 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 patrickforce  staff   220B Aug  7 07:45 modules.json
drwxr-xr-x  3 patrickforce  staff    96B Aug  7 07:45 security_group
```

We see the module itself downloaded to the `security_group` directory, so there's Terraform source code in there that will actually be used when we run our configuration. `modules.json` is just a metadata file to track Terraform's awareness of pulled modules and such.

OK, on to the next part of the `init` output

```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.70.0...
```

Initializing the backend: we'll refresh more on later, but this is Terraform preparing for interaction with remote state in short.

Along with identifying and downloading modules, `init` also identifies providers defined in source and downloads the provider plugins. Remember that providers are key to Terraform. They're the things to define a bulk of the actual functionality when using Terraform, and are supported via a plugin architecture. For example, I want to create and manage resources in AWS, so I make use of the AWS provider which encapsulates all of the functionality to have Terraform interact with the AWS APIs to run these creation and management operations. If we look at our Terraform source for the provider definition:

```
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.0" # this version constraint says that we need to use the most recent 2.x version of the provider
  region  = "${var.region}" # we're using 0.12, and newer versions will warn us if we write this "${var.region}" instead of var.region
                            # but 0.11 and versions before don't support the syntax here
}
```

`terraform init` sees this provider block defined with a version constraint of `version = "~> 2.0"` and knows that it needs to go get the AWS provider matching this version constraint if it's not already available locally. `Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.70.0...` from the logs indicates that it found the version it needs and is downloading it. This provider, or plugin is also pulled into the `.terraform` directory:

```
$ ls -la .terraform/plugins/linux_amd64/
total 371144
drwxr-xr-x  4 patrickforce  staff        128 Aug  7 07:45 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 patrickforce  staff         96 Aug  7 07:45 ..
-rwxr-xr-x  1 patrickforce  staff         79 Aug  7 07:45 lock.json
-rwxr-xr-x  1 patrickforce  staff  189435008 Aug  7 07:45 terraform-provider-aws_v2.70.0_x4
```

A provider or plugin is nothing more than a compiled binary that Terraform calls in the execution of terraform commands. This provider binary for AWS is now available locally so that Terraform can make use of it for creating and managing AWS-related resources and other AWS related operations built-in to the provider.

Next, we see some output from our `init` command that implies that `init` does some basic syntax checking, which indeed it does!

```
Warning: Interpolation-only expressions are deprecated

  on main.tf line 10, in provider "aws":
  10:   region  = "${var.region}" # we're using 0.12, and newer versions will warn us if we write this "${var.region}" instead of var.region

Terraform 0.11 and earlier required all non-constant expressions to be
provided via interpolation syntax, but this pattern is now deprecated. To
silence this warning, remove the "${ sequence from the start and the }"
sequence from the end of this expression, leaving just the inner expression.

Template interpolation syntax is still used to construct strings from
expressions when the template includes multiple interpolation sequences or a
mixture of literal strings and interpolations. This deprecation applies only
to templates that consist entirely of a single interpolation sequence.
```

This will be a common warning that will appear in any project where you're transitioning from Terraform <=0.11 to >= 0.12. HCL and Terraform 0.12 have deprecated a number of syntactical approaches in previous versions. One of them being the above, where 0.12 wants you to use string interpolation only when you're actually interpolating. In the case of `"${var.region}"`, we're really only dealing with a variable value, nothing that needs to be concatenated, interpolated, etc. So, we'd want to update it to `var.region` while working with 0.12. Let's do that, and also update any others you find like this that need fixing, and then re-run init:

```
$ terraform init
Initializing modules...

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

If you've fixed all, you should see output like the above. No more warnings. It's also worth noting that we no longer get output, nothing really happened during the module and provider plugin initialization. This is because the `terraform init` command is idempotent. We've already downloaded the versions of modules and provider plugins needed. Terraform is able to determine that and not attempt a download again. If you wanted to force re-download modules and plugins, you could use the `-upgrade=true` arg for the `init` command

```
$ terraform init -upgrade=true
Upgrading modules...
Downloading terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws 3.13.0 for security_group...
- security_group in .terraform/modules/security_group/terraform-aws-security-group-3.13.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

### The root `terraform` block

OK, let's go start to actually look at our configuration source. You'll notice in `main.tf` there's a root `terraform` block defined like:

```
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.12.26"
}
```

This simply gives us a way to ensure that no terraform commands can be run against this configuration unless the version of the `terraform` CLI being used is at least version `0.12.26`. This root terraform settings block is also where you configure remote backend settings, which we'll get back to soon, as well as a few other things like experimental feature enablement.

### A look at the rest of the source

We have some additional files here in source:

* `variables.tf`: where we define terraform input variable declarations, so the parameters that can be passed in to our project
* `terraform.tfvars`: one of the ways in which we can pass in those variable values or parameters
* `outputs.tf`: where we define terraform project outputs, so dynamic values to be passed back out of the project
* `main.tf`: our main file containing resource and data source definitions

Let's look at the rest of `main.tf`

```
data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}

locals {
  vpc_id_tag = "default-${data.aws_vpc.default.id}"
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "my_key_pair" {
  key_name   = "rockholla-di-${var.student_alias}"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD3F6tyPEFEzV0LX3X8BsXdMsQz1x2cEikKDEY0aIj41qgxMCP/iteneqXSIFZBp5vizPvaoIR3Um9xK7PGoW8giupGn+EPuxIA4cDM4vzOqOkiMPhz5XK0whEjkVzTo4+S0puvDZuwIsdiW9mxhJc7tgBNL0cYlWSYVkz4G/fslNfRPW5mYAM49f4fhtxPb5ok4Q2Lg9dPKVHO/Bgeu5woMc7RY0p1ej6D4CKFE6lymSDJpW0YHX/wqE9+cfEauh7xZcG0q9t2ta6F6fmX0agvpFyZo8aFbXeUBr7osSCJNgvavWbM/06niWrOvYX2xwWdhXmXSrbX8ZbabVohBK41 ${var.student_alias}+di@rockholla.org"
  tags = {
    in_vpc = local.vpc_id_tag
  }
}

resource "aws_eip" "my_eip" {
  vpc = true
  tags = {
    in_vpc = local.vpc_id_tag
  }
}

module "security_group" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"
  version = "3.13.0"
  name = var.student_alias
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.default.id
}

```

our first block, or stanza is a data source, and one that's going to query the AWS API by way of the AWS provider that our `init` command downloaded. We're using a provider-defined data source called `aws_vpc`. We want to query to get info about a VPC that _already exists_ in our AWS. In this case the default VPC for the region as configured in our AWS provider block.

We can then reference the VPC's ID in other places. And we see that happen as we're setting a local variable:

```
locals {
  vpc_id_tag = "default-vpc-${data.aws_vpc.default.id}"
}
```

We're using string interpolation to set a local variable called `vpc_id_tag` that contains the value of our default VPC id. Remember locals are values that can be re-used within your configuration, but aren't passed in. We're setting up this local to use it in a few other places within our config: setting tags on multiple other resources

The final 3 blocks in this file represent resources we want to create and manage via Terraform in our AWS infrastructure:

* an AWS key pair
* an AWS elastic IP
* an AWS security group care of the community module being used to create the resource

Let's run a `terraform plan` now and look through the output:

```
$ terraform plan
var.region
  the region where resources will be created

  Enter a value: us-west-1

var.student_alias
  Your student alias

  Enter a value: force

    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
```

You've been prompted for values to the defined input variables in the `variables.tf` file:

```
# we keep variables in a separate file simply as a matter of best-practice
# under-the-hood Terraform will merge all files together, and doesn't really care whether
# HCL is in one file or many

variable "region" {
  description = "the region where resources will be created"
}

variable "student_alias" {
  description = "Your student alias"
}

```

We have no defaults defined for these variables, thus Terraform needs values for them, so it's prompting us. Something we can do to prevent being prompted is to put values in our `terraform.tfvars` file. Open that file and edit with the following info, replacing `[student-alias]` with your assigned student alias:

```
# fill in your variables accordingly here
student_alias="[student-alias]"
region="us-west-1"
```

And run `terraform plan` again. You should not be prompted. Terraform will read input values from the `terraform.tfvars` file to get the values it needs. Do you remember all the other ways you can pass in variable values in automated ways?

Finally, let's take a look at our `outputs.tf` file:

```
output "eip_public_ip" {
  value = "${aws_eip.my_eip.public_ip}"
}
```

Outputs are useful pieces of data to come out of a particular Terraform project or module. In this case, we're referencing a value that was filled in upon creating our AWS elastic IP resource. AWS internally created that resource and assigned a public IP to it. We can reference that output or attribute of the resource, and pass it out of our project as well. This particular example might be useful if you have other processes or other projects after this one that needs this IP to, say, update DNS records.

Notice that 0.12 didn't give us a warning for a value contained within `"${..}"` for outputs.

That's it for this refresher exercise. We won't actually apply any of this configuration.
